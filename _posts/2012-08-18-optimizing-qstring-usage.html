title: "Optimizing QString usage"
description: >
  Qt is a great framework- elegant, easy to use, cross platform etc.  However just like any framework there are certain things you have to watch out for.  What I have discovered is, if you are not careful, you can experience a considerable slowdown in time intensive operations if you are using a lot QStrings. In this article I will demonstrate the problems, and also the solutions!

<h3>String literals and QStrings</h3>

<p>
There are a lot of methods and functions in Qt that take QStrings as arguments, and I'm sure you have too. But some cases you need to pass a hardcoded string every time- a string literal- for example when comparing strings. In this short example we parse some xml, and compare the tag name to a string:
</p>
    
{% highlight cpp %}
void parseNode(QXmlStreamReader& xml) {
    // assert we are parsing a node
    Q_ASSERT(xml.isStartElement() && xml.name() == "node");
     
    while (xml.readNextStartElement()) {
        if (xml.name() == "subNode") {
            // yell when we see a subNode
            qDebug() << "found subNode!"
        }
        xml.skipCurrentElement();
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
This looks like very innocent code, but if this is part of parsing code that will be called thousands of times when parsing large XML files, QString temporaries rear their head. Where do they come from, you ask? Let's look at that if statement:
</p>
    
{% highlight cpp %}
if (xml.name() == "subNode")
{% endhighlight %}
    
<p>
To understand what's happening, let's break it down into the calls made.
</p>
    
<ul>
    <li><code>xml.name()</code> actually returns <code>QStringRef</code></li>
    <li><code>QStringRef</code> has <code>bool operator==</code> that compares
    itself to <code>QString</code>, so we need to make one to compare to</li>
    <li><code>QString</code> has an implicit constructor <code>QString ( const char * str )</code> </li>
</ul>

<p>
Putting all that together we actually get:
</p>

{% highlight cpp %}
if (operator== ( QString("subNode"), xml.name() ))
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
We are creating a temporary <code>QString</code> at each one of those if
statements! Looking at the Qt <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qstring.html#QString-8">documentation for the <code>QString</code>
constructor</a>, it converts the <code>const char*</code> to unicode.
This <code>QString</code> is then immediately destroyed after the comparison.
What a waste of resources!
</p>

<p>
    At this point you may think to abandon QStrings, and use something like<a
        href="http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/">TinyXml</a>, but how can we
    deal with our problem in Qt? After all, this isn't just an XML parsing problem, this relates to QString usage in general.
</p>

<h3>QString constants</h3>

<p>The solution to the problem (or hack if you will), is to define
<code>QString</code> constants for keywords that are used frequently in string
comparisons. This means the <code>QString</code> will be created once, and we won't be
dealing with temporary copies and destructions. Here's a simple example:
</p>

{% highlight cpp %}
// initialize a string constant to be reused.
// could be local to a function, global to a translation unit,
// or in some commonly referenced file of constants
static const subNodeText = QString("subNode");

if (xml.name() == subNodeText) {
    // yell when we see a subNode
    qDebug() << "found subNode!"
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
    Of course this would be ridiculous if the constant is used once, but adds up
    very quickly if it used tens of thousands of times or more. 
</p>

<h3>Benchmarks</h3>

This post would be completely pointless without benchmarks of course, so let's
create a really dumb test:
