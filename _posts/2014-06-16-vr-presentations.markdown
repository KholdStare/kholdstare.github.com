### [A Sense of Scale in VR](/presentations/vr-scale)

This is my article on Sense of Scale in VR, made into a presentation, and shown
at the [4th Toronto VR Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/TorontoVR/events/175128952/).
I was pleased to see the audience engaged, and asking great questions
throughout. They seemed to always anticipate my next slide!

Readers are free to use these slides for their presentations

### [VR Jam Postmortem](/presentations/vr-jam-post-mortem)

These slides chronicle the ups and downs of the Oculus VR Jam held last year,
and were presented at the [5th Toronto VR Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/TorontoVR/events/182882212/).
I go over the tools chosen, ideas brainstormed, and problems tackled!
